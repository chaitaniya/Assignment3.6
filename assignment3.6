 Q.1..Can you overload a method with same return type.? Explain your answer with proper logic.
 Ans.
 Yes we can overload method with same return type but the argument list should be diffrent.
  If it is the case that arguments are same as that of the other then aleast the sequence of the arguments should be changed.
  Method Overloading means to have two or more methods with same name in the same class with different arguments. 
  The benefit of method overloading is that it allows you to implement methods that support the same semantic operation but differ
  by argument number or type.

Important Points
Overloaded methods MUST change the argument list
Overloaded methods CAN change the return type
Overloaded methods CAN change the access modifier
Overloaded methods CAN declare new or broader checked exceptions
A method can be overloaded in the same class or in a subclass

Program:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class acad {
	public static int sum(int a , int b)
    {
		return a+b; 
    }
    public static int  sum(char c)  
    {
    	int n =(int)c;
         return n;
    }
	
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("output");
		System.out.println(sum(a,b));//sum with integer type as input
		System.out.println(sum('a'));//	sum with char type as input
		}
	}
  
  import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;


Q.2Write a program in java using Arrays, that sorts the element in descending order.
Ans:
public class acad {

	
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int []a=new int[n];
		
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			a[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		
		Arrays.sort(a);
		
		for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
		{
			System.out.println(a[i]);
		}
	}
}
